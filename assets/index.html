            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>For over 50 years, GP-3 consulting has helped thousands of satisfied customers increase their revenue stream. Our process is very simple- we listen to exactly what you want.
                We will come to your offices and review all files to see exactly where your business needs help. <br> Once we have identified the areas that need the most improvement, we will work 
                with you to formulate a plan to make the necessary channges. Once we have come to an agreement, we will work together to implement these changes and train you on how to train your<br>
                employees on these changes. Once the changes are implemented, we will have 2 of our industry professionals integrated into your company for 8 weeks, just in case any minor hiccups come up.
                After the 8 week period, your account Manager will set up a meeting to make<br>sure the changes have been effective. At this meeting, we strongly recommend having all of you Department Managers
                affected by the implemented changes present so we can have a Q&A together. This is also the opportunity for us to hear from the 2 employees that<br>were integrated into your company during the 
                8 week period to see where the strengths are that we can build on and what areas need additional training. As long as the areas are not big or there are no major issues from these new implementations,
                we will turn complete<br>operations back over to your organization. Once this is done, we will continue to hold bi-weekly meetings with your organization for 3 months to make sure
                we can address any possible interruptions. After the 3 months, we will have monthly meetings with your organization<br>and make recommendations we have based on your organizations feedback
                and the analytical data provided to us for a period on 9 months. At the end of this year, you will have the option to continue with monthly meetings.
